The results I observed in terms of growth rates were consistent with my expectations, but the
numbers themselves were not. For example, constant held steady, but held steady at around
200000, which seemed very large for a program of O(1) and consisted solely of a print function.
My exponential function grew at an exponential rate, however did not grow at a rate of 2^N. I expected
it to grow at a slower rate, but likely due to some slow-downs within the code, it was larger, for example
at N^20 it returned 1688373. The cubic function, while seeming to grow at a rate consistent with the
growth curve of cubic functions, the numbers returned were much too large. This issue became less severe
as the N value became larger, the differences first being by magnitudes of ten and then simply double the size.
